# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

# Creating a list of numbers from 1 to 10
numbers = list(range(1, 11))

# Extracting the first five elements
first_five = numbers[:5]

# Reversing the extracted list
reversed_list = first_five[::-1]

# Displaying results
print("Original first five numbers:", first_five)
print("Reversed list:", reversed_list)
